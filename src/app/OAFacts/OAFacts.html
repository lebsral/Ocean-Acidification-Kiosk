<h3 class="md-title">Importance of our oceans</h3>
<p class="md-body-1"><ul><li>The oceans provide many things that are necessary for human life on earth.</li>
<li>The ocean is a primary driver of weather and climate.</li>
<li>The ocean is a source of clean fresh water – most of the rain that falls on land comes from the tropical ocean.</li>
<li>The phytoplankton or microscopic plants that live in the ocean are responsible for almost half the oxygen we breath.</li>
<li>Many people in Alaska and throughout the world depend on marine fish for livelihood, sustenance, and culture.</li></ul>
  </p>
 <h3 class="md-title">Acidification Trend</h3>
<p class="md-body-1"><ul><li>One way that the oceans help to stabilize our climate is by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Globally, oceans have absorbed about a quarter of human carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels (to power our homes and run our cars). Carbon dioxide emissions have increased exponentially since the industrial revolution.</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide is an acid gas: it forms carbonic acid when it dissolves in seawater!</li>
<li>Ocean acidification is the name for the change in the ocean chemistry caused by this absorption of increased carbon dioxide.</li>
<li>Ocean acidity has increased by 30% due to human emitted carbon dioxide.</li>
<li>Ocean acidity varies due to a variety of natural processes, but scientists have shown that all oceans are now acidifying.</li>
<li>While ocean acidification events have occurred in Earth’s history, oceans are now acidifying at a rate that is 10-100 times faster than any such shift in the past 50 million years.</li></ul></p>

<h3 class="md-title">Ecosystem Impacts</h3>
<p class="md-body-1"><ul><li>Ocean acidification causes a number of changes in ocean chemistry that affect marine life. We know that ocean acidification will make it harder for marine animals like shellfish and corals to produce and maintain the shells and skeletons they make from calcium carbonate building blocks.</li>
<li>Many of these “calcifying” species — like the pteropod — are vital food sources for salmon, whales and birds and are also particularly sensitive to acidification.</li>
<li>Ocean acidification can cause decreased survival, growth rates, and reproduction in crab, oysters and other shellfish.</li>
<li>Because the marine ecosystem is so thoroughly connected, shifts that impact one part of the food web create chain reactions and can cause community-wide impacts, ultimately impacting human communities on land. Ocean acidification has the potential to majorly affect the ecology of the ocean and human communities who are tied to it.</li></ul></p>

<h3 class="md-title">Ocean Acidification in Alaska</h3>
<p class="md-body-1"><ul><li>Cold water naturally absorbs and holds more carbon dioxide than warmer water. This and other natural phenomena, like a coastline with lots of rivers, make Alaska particularly sensitive to ocean acidification.</li>
<li>Alaskan communities are increasingly concerned about how ocean acidification will impact marine resources because the state relies heavily on thriving fisheries for livelihood, sustenance and culture.</li>
<li>A growing dialogue around the progression and impacts of acidification, as well as ways to reduce and adapt its causes and effects, can help to make Alaska a leader in ocean acidification awareness and action.</li></ul></p>
