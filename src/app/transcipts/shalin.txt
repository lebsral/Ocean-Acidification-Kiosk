Ocean Chemistry is changing at one of the fastest rates ever in the Earth's history.  And we know that marine species can live in a variety of chemistry environments.

But we know that marine ecosystems and the species that comprise them
respond to change.  And in periods in the Earth's History, where we have seen big drops in pH an acidification event, there have been turnover of marine ecosystems, marine species. And they have changed

My name is Shalin Bush. I'm a scientist for NOAA, which is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

So, the impacts of Ocean Acidification on marine ecosystems
can happen in a variety of ways and what is interesting to think about is that for ecosystems to change, not all species inside of the ecosystem need to be sensitive, directly, to changes in Carbon chemistry.

And so what we are concerned about is charismatic species that get a lot of attention, by society, and people really care about. Like birds, and whales and big fish like salmon. Might be affected by Ocean Acidification because of the impacts on their prey.
