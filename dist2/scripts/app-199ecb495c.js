Acidification has the potential to majorly affect the ecology of the ocean and human communities who are tied to it.</p><br><h3 class="md-title">Ocean Acidification in Alaska</h3><p class="md-body-1">Cold water naturally absorbs and holds more carbon dioxide than warmer water. This and other natural phenomena, like a coastline with lots of carbon-rich river run-off, make Alaska particularly sensitive to acidification. Alaskans are increasingly concerned about acidification impacts to marine resources, including a thriving fishing tradition vital for livelihood, sustenance and culture.</p></div></div></div><header><acme-navbar></acme-navbar></header></md-content>'),e.put("app/Splash/splash.html",'<button ui-sref="voices"><img src="assets/images/WhatisOA.png" alt="What is OA" id="bg"></button>'),e.put("app/act-now/act-now.html",'<md-content><div class="factslayout"><div layout="row" class="ActNowPretty" layout-align="space-around center"><div flex="60"><div class="actheader"><h3>Join our mailing list to learn how you can help.</h3></div><form name="userForm"><md-input-container><input focus="" placeholder="First Name..." ng-model="newFirstName"><br></md-input-container><md-input-container><input placeholder="Last Name..." ng-model="newLastName"><br></md-input-container><md-input-container><input placeholder="City, State..." ng-model="newPlace"><br></md-input-container><md-input-container><input type="email" required="" placeholder="Email..." ng-model="newEmail"><br></md-input-container><h3><div class="emaillistheader">Send me more information about:</div></h3><div layout="column" class="logos"><div layout="row"><div><md-input-container><md-checkbox ng-model="newOAList" aria-label="on OA info list">Ocean Acidification</md-checkbox></md-input-container></div><div><md-input-container><md-checkbox ng-model="newCoalList" aria-label="on Coal list">Coal mining in Alaska</md-checkbox></md-input-container></div><div><md-input-container><md-checkbox ng-model="newLegList" aria-label="on Legislationlist">Current legislation</md-checkbox></md-input-container></div></div><div><md-input-container><md-button class="md-buttonSend" type="submit" ng-click="addEmail(newEmail, newFirstName, newLastName, newPlace, newOAList, newCoalList, newLegList);newEmail = null; newFirstName = null;newLastName = null; newPlace = null; newOAList = true; newCoalList = false; newLegList = false"><h3><div class="textsend">Send</div></h3></md-button></md-input-container></div></div></form></div><div flex="30"><div layout="row" class="logos"><div><img src="assets/images/logo.png" class="logoOnNav"></div><div><img src="assets/images/cookinletkeeperlogo.png" class="logoOnNav"></div></div><md-card><div class="modcard"><p class="cardstuff"></p><h3 class="md-title actcardtitle">What Else Can I Do?</h3><div class="cardbody"><p class="md-body-1"><ul><li>Tell a friend or family member about acidification and why you care about our ocean.</li><br><li>Tell your local legislator.</li><br><li>Help expand the public transportation system in your community.</li><br><li>Explore wind energy and other alternative energy options.</li><br><li>Join a citizen science program.</li></ul></p></div><p></p></div></md-card></div></div></div><header><acme-navbar></acme-navbar></header></md-content>'),e.put("app/lookcloser/lookcloser.html",'<md-content><div layout="row" layout-align="space-around center"><div flex="80"><div class="videogular-container"><videogular vg-player-ready="lookcloser.onPlayerReady($API)" vg-complete="lookcloser.onCompleteVideo()" vg-theme="lookcloser.config.theme.url"><vg-media vg-src="lookcloser.config.sources" vg-tracks="lookcloser.config.tracks"></vg-media><vg-buffering></vg-buffering></videogular></div></div></div><header><acme-navbar></acme-navbar></header></md-content>'),e.put("app/main/main.html",'<md-content><div layout="row" layout-align="space-around center"><div class="videogular-container"><videogular vg-player-ready="main.onPlayerReady($API)" vg-complete="main.onCompleteVideo()" vg-theme="main.config.theme.url"><vg-media vg-src="main.config.sources" vg-tracks="main.config.tracks"></vg-media><vg-controls class="ontopofvid"><vg-play-pause-button></vg-play-pause-button><vg-time-display>{{ currentTime | date:\'mm:ss\':\'+0000\' }}</vg-time-display><vg-scrub-bar><vg-scrub-bar-current-time></vg-scrub-bar-current-time></vg-scrub-bar><vg-time-display>{{ timeLeft | date:\'mm:ss\':\'+0000\' }}</vg-time-display><vg-volume><vg-mute-button></vg-mute-button><vg-volume-bar></vg-volume-bar></vg-volume><vg-fullscreen-button></vg-fullscreen-button></vg-controls><vg-overlay-play></vg-overlay-play><vg-buffering></vg-buffering><vg-poster vg-url="main.config.plugins.poster"></vg-poster></videogular></div></div><div ng-show="main.API.currentState != \'play\'" class="navwaves" id="navID"><div class="navwavesbutton" layout-align="center center"><div ng-repeat="video in main.videos"><md-button class="md-buttonnav" ng-click="main.setVideo({{ $index }})"><div class="navtext">{{video.sources[0].name}}</div></md-button></div><img src="assets/images/backgroundwaves.png" class="bgwaves"></div></div></md-content>'),
